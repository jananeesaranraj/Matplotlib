**Background**
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

**Analysis**

1.Capomulin and Ramicane drug treatments look effective compared to other drug regimens while comparing the average tumor volume on the course of 45 days.

2.Number of Mice tested for Capomulin and Ramicane is more than the other drug regimens.

3.Percentage of male mice tested is more than the female mice.

4.As per the line plot,the tumor volume has reduced in the course of time for the mice l509 using the drug Capomulin

5.There are no outliers for Capomulin,Ramicane and Ceftamin except Infubinol which has one outlier.

6.There is a strong positive Correlation between Mouse weight and average tumor volume.
